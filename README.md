## GENERAL NOTES

### MODULE NUMBERING

Many but not all aluminum boxes have numbers such as AM-09 engraved into the front of each box. These numbers, however, don't correspond to the current collection of boxes. For instance, there's a AM-09, but we only currently have 8 adder-multipliers. I have initiated a new numbering scheme, written in marker on the inside of the module. A cross reference will be created to resolve any ambiguities.
